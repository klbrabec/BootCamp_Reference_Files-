Pandas also utilizes other libraries 
biggest thing that pandas helps with is dataframes 

pd.Series() - creates a one dimensional array of data. 
a Data Frame consists of multiple series. 

A series is a column of data 
a data frame is similar to a spreadsheet - multiple columns 
series and data frames are both indexed using standard python indexing. 

The brackets tell you what order the cells run in. (Helpful for troubleshooting if things aren't working)
the In [*] will tell you that a cell is currently running

encountered by the interpreter.

> create from a list of dictionaries
> create from a disctionary of lists
