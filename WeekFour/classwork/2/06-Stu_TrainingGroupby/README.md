# Training Grounds

## Instructions

* Using the DataFrame provided, do the following:

    * Convert the "Membership (Days)" column into weeks and then add this new series into the DataFrame

    * Create a Dataframe that has only the "Trainer", "Weight", and membership in days and weeks.

    * Using groupby get the average weight and length membership of the gym members for each trainer.

## Bonus

* If you have extra time, try creating and comparing additional groups! Consider using multiple columns in your `groupby` statement and exploring how grouping can help summarize different selections.
