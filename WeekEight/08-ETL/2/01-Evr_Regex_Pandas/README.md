# Regex Matching with Pandas

In this activity, you'll use the Pandas `str.contains()` function to find text that contains matching patterns.

## Instructions

1. Using the provided starter code, load `sherlock.txt` into a DataFrame named `sherlock_df`.

2. Create regular expression patterns to find all the lines that contain the following:

    * The "Watson" string
    * The "Watson" string followed by a white space character
    * The "Watson" string followed by a nonword character
    * The "Watson" string followed by a white space character that's then followed by a word character
    * A doctor's name, including the "Dr." string
    * The title of a book in uppercase letters
    * The title of a book in uppercase letters with a hyphen (`-`)
