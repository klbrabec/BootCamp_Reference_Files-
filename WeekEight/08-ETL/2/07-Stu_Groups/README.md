# Groups

In this activity, you’ll use capture groups to further refine regular expression matches.

## Instructions

1. Load the "Alice in Wonderland" text into a DataFrame named `alice_df`.

2. Create a regular expression that extracts all the words containing 12 or more letters.

3. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that comes after the "Alice" string, and count the frequency of those words.

4. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that contains five or more letters and that comes after the "Alice" string, and count the frequency of those words.

5. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that contains five or more letters, that comes after the "Alice" string, and that does not end in "ly", and count the frequency of those words.
