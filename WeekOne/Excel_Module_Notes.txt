Formulas/Charts/Pivot Tables - set the stage for Data Visualization, languages and tools 
Hosted file - stored online - with the intention to share via download or hyperlink 
Local file - physically stored on local computer

Bottom right - zoom % indicates the magnification of the text. 

Tabular data - data displayed in a column and row format 
|________________|________________|_________________|

Initial review of a spreadsheet 
    How many columns and rows are there?
    What types of data are present?
    Is it readable or does it need to be converted in some way? 

CTRL Right Arrow - takes you to the right most column 
CTRL Down Arrow - Takes you to the last row. 

Note - sometimes data isn't classified correctly - you should double check. 
Putting data in the right format will allow you to perform
    Categorization
    Sorting
    Statistics 
Format entire columns vs single cells where possible 
Tool to convert a timestamp to a human readable value -https://www.epochconverter.com/

Timestamp -
    Characters or information that has been encoded to identify the time an event has or will occur
    Unix Timestamp - the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1/1/1970.  (without the inclusion of leap seconds)
    Range will end 1/19/2038
    Need a new method to convert to 64 bit
    Unix Time converter
        Can convert a timestamp into date/time 
        Cannot go beyond 1/1/1900 1/19/2038 
        Can be used to identify/convert date/time based on a person's time zone 

Convert to date/time stamp in excel 
    strtotime() - converts data to a unix time stamp 

Filters - allow you to display only the data we want to focus on
    Filter on a single column 
    -Select column
    -Data tab
    -Filter 

Freezing - allows portions of a spreadsheet to be locked in place so it is always displayed 

    Freeze row
    Freeze column 
    Freeze pane 
        (top and to the left of the selected cell)

Conditional formatting 
    Customizing the appearance of a cell based on its value. 
    Conditional formatting (low to high)
        If not a smooth transition - can expose an outlier 
    Shifting to percentile can smooth out the transitions with the outliers still included. 

iferror() - 
    Catches errors and replaces them with user defined input 

Nesting - one formula is nested inside another (both will run simultaneously)
    the iferror() is designed to nest. 

Text to columns - 
    Can break apart columns where there is a consistent delimiter 

VLookup - pulls specific columns from the main dataset into a new sheet without having to search and copy/paste 

Measures of Central Tendency
    The tendency of data to be towards the middle of the dataset. 
    mean - sum of the data divided by the number of data points
    median - what is the midpoint of the data?
    mode - what value shows up the most 
    When the mean and median are close together, the data is considered symmetric. 
    If the mean is significantly different than the median - thinks are skewed. 
        skewed right - mean is higher than median
        skewed left - mean is lower than median 
    skewness - statistic that defines how asymmetrical a distribution is. 
    Excel does not have a mean function - it uses average 

Measures of spread 
    2 datasets can have the same mean or medium but look completely different 
    Range
        Span between the maxium value of the data set and the minimum value of the dataset. 
    Variance 
        How far datapoints are from the mean 
            Subtract the mean from the point 
            Square the difference 
            Take the average of the differences because the values are squared - they don't quite match
            To get it to match - take the square root - this is the standard deviation 
    Standard deviation
        To calculate:
            Find the mean
            Subtract the mean from each number in the dataset and square the number
            Find the mean of the new numbers
            Take the square root of the mean 

        To correct the bias of a smaller variance than the actual population, you divide the sum of squared variances by the number of samples - 1
        (Bessel's correction)

    Quartiles 
        done on a dataset that is arranged from lowest to highest. 
            lower quartile - 25% of the data is less than this point
            upper quartile - 25% of the data is higher than this point (75% is lower)
            Median 
        difference between the upper and lower quartiles is the interquartile range 
            this is a guide on how far you can go from the mean to get 50% of the data 
        IQR = Q3 - Q1 - IQR tells us how the data is spread around the median. 
    The inner quartile rule can be used to find outliers. 
        Multiple IQR by 1.5 
        Add to Q1 and Q3 - any number below (for Q1) or above (for Q3) should be considered an outlier 

    Excel Formulas - 
    STDEV.P - Standard deviation of a population 
    STDEV.S - Standard deviation of a sample 
    QUARTILE.EXC 

    When standard deviations are larger than the mean, everything below the mean is close to the center. 

    Outliers
        Identifying outliers eliminates (or identifies) extreme data points that are not representative of the desired data 
        Can use
            Mean and standard deviation 
            OR
            median and interquartile range 
        Any value greater than the upper quartile + 1.5*IQR 
        Any value less than the lower quartile - 1.5*IQR
        THESE ARE OUTLIERS 

        Medians and Quartiles are robust statistics - meaning they are less sensitive to outliers 
        Mean and standard deviaition is less accurate but less labor intensive 

    When an outlier is identified - 
        Correct it if it's wrong, but if it is accurate - leave it in and tell the full story of your data 
    
    Visualizing data with BoxPlots 
        effective way to show large amounts of information about a distribution 
        (Also called box and whisper plots)
