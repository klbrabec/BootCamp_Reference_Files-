Night One _______________
"Lots of hard work and late nights" 
Miss no more than 8 classes
2 incomplete/unsubmitted assignments
Participate in all projects
Payment - don't miss payments or it can lead to academic hold 
~30 hour commitment a week
One person's strength is another person's weakness 
When one succeeds, we ALL succeed. 
Office Hours - 30 minutes before class/1 hour after class
Treat homework like a work deadline 
Get the big picture of data and data visualizations 
Start the challenges right after you finish the pre-work for each week 
All classes will be recorded - should be available by the next morning

GitLab/GitHub 
    This is where we will be pulling class materials from. 
    GitHub - this is where we will be posting/submitting classwork 
    GitLab - we will only pull material from here. 

VLookup -
    Values in a vertical column $before column and row - will maintain values when dragged down a column or across a row 
    False = exact match 
HLoookup 
    Looks for values horizontally
    Wants the ROW index, not the column 
    False = Exact match 
    Nest in an iferror to indicate that something is not found. 

Night Two_____________________
Stay ahead and ontime where you can.
Get tutor assistance as you need it - they can be helpful (sign up for this)
What's your passion?  This will drive where your focus is. 

GitHub 
    Web interface for git 
    Push - upload
    Pull - download 
    You can revert back to a previous point if things go wrong 

Best practice to have a readme file with descriptive information 
This is the file that displays when you open your repo 

Make it a practice to include a python git ignore
    This allows you to ignore specific files when uploading 

.md - markdown extension 
    Formatting languagesVS Code/Text editor we are working with. 
If you upload a file with the same name -it will overwrite things - but you can revert and see changes if needed.
Can drag and drop to insert images into the markdown file. 

Download things BEFORE class 

Charts - recommended charts is a good place to start 
    + sign on the chart allows you to add/edit formatting 
        Style
        color schemes 

Without having something described, a viewer should be able to get an idea of what the data is showing.

Ctrl/Shift/Arrow - does selections enmasse without the mouse 

Eventually can make interactive filters and charts 
Think of your data as a story telling tool 

Switch row/column on a chart will 'flip' how excel guesses for you. 

Mean - Average 
Median - middle 
Mode - Most frequently occurring 

Depending on the skew, the average may not be the best description of your data 
    Left skew distribution
    Normal distribution
    Right skew distribution 

Be careful with how you are asking your questions to not bias things. 

Extreme values in a dataset are not always reliable 

Histogram - shows the frequency data shows up. 
Standard errors
Central limit theorem 

Quantiles 
    Quartiles - 4 equal parts 
    Percentiles - 100 equal parts 

Box and whisker plots - will show you if there is an outlier in your data
