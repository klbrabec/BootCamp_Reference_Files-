Git - version control software 
    Tracks changes to any files in your project 
    allows you to roll back to undo changes
    push - adds code to the repo
    pull - download from the repo

    Facilitates the rolling back of code to previous versions. 
Git is the most widely used version control system.

Creating a new repository in Git 
    Best practice - initialize the repository with a readme file 
    Clone w SSh (under the code button)
    In the terminal window (gitbash) - change the directory to where you want to put your code
    Type 'git clone' and the URL that is copied from GitHub
    Hit enter - the system will clone the structure from the indicated URL. 

Git Commands 
    git add -a - adds all files in the repository to be uploaded to the repo in the cloud. 
    git commit -m 'Message' - commits the file to the current branch 
    git push origin main - pushes the code into the indicated branch in the repo 
    git checkout -b BRANCHNAME - checks out a new branch with the indicated name
